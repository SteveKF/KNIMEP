    <name>Diversity Significance Based Resolver</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        An algorithm which computes a k-representative skyline based on significance and diversity. 
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node creates a k-representative skyline based on significance and diversity.
        For the diversity value the number of data records between two data records are counted and divided through the number of 
        skyline points. The higher the value the more diverse are these two data records.
        In contrast to this the significance of a dimension is computed with a threshold. 
        If the value of a data record for this dimension is above or under this threshold its significant. 
        Therefore the threshold behaves like a lower or upper bound. 
        If the threshold is given as a interval a data record is significant if its value lies in this interval.
        If no threshold is given data records have the same significance.<br/>

        <option name="Size of the representative skyline">Parameter which tells how many data records should be in the representative skyline.</option>
        <option name="Weights">Weights for significance and diversity. A higher diversity weight returns more diverse data records and vice versa.</option>
        <option name="Dimension Selection Box">Select which dimension should get a threshold.</option>
        <option name="Threshold Options">Single: A single value for a threshold. A data record is significant if its value for the selected dimension
        is higher or lower than the threshold. Higher if the threshold is used as a lower bound or lower if it's used as a upper bound.<br/>
        Range: A data record is significant if its value for the selected dimension lies in the interval of the entered values.<br/>
        None: If data records should be significant equally for the selected dimension.<br/>
        </option>
        <option name="Single">Enter a value for a upper or lower bound threshold. With a checked box the threshold will be used as a upper bound.
        Therefore values below this threshold are significant and vice versa if the box isn't checked. </option>
        <option name="Range">Enter a lower and upper bound for the threshold interval.</option>
