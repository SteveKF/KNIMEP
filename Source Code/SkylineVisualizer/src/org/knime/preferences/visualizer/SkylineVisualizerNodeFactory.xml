    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node creates a coordinate system for every dimension combination which has a preference on it.
        The coordinate system contains dominated and undominated points in different colors.
        The coordinate systems are created for two or three dimensions. Dimensions which are not numeric won't be considered.</intro>
        
        <option name="Dimension Chooser">Select two or three dimensions which should be displayed in the view.</option>
        <option name="Graph Label">Option for different chart name, subtitle and legend names for dominated and undominated points.</option>
        <option name="Chart name">A custom chart name can be entered if the custom option was chosen.</option>
        <option name="Subtitle">A custom subtitle name can be entered if the custom option was chosen.</option>
