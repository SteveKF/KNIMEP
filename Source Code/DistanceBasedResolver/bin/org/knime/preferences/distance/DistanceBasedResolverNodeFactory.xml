    <name>Distance Based Resolver</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
    The Distance Based Resolver node computes the representative skyline by minimizing the distance between a non-representative skyline
    point and its nearest representative.    
	</shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node computes the k data points which are the center of the circles which possess the lowest radius 
        and cover the most skyline points. The algorithm minimizes the distance between a non-representative skyline point
		and its nearest representative. Because of this the algorithm returns the most diverse data records. 
		The algorithm was implemented for only two dimensions.<br/>
		The algorithm can be looked up in: Tao, Yufei, et al. "Distance-based representative skyline." 2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering. IEEE, 2009.
